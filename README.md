# Mapping donations to WA state candidates

This repository maps donations to candidates in the 2020 Washington State 
general election

## Data sources

- **Campaign donations**: I used the "Contributions to Candidates and Political
  Committees" [API](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.wa.gov/kv7h-kjye) 
  provided by the WA state [Public Disclosure Commission](https://www.pdc.wa.gov/).
  This data can also be accessed online through the [PDC 
  website](https://data.wa.gov/Politics/Contributions-to-Candidates-and-Political-Committe/kv7h-kjye/data).
